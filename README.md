Projects Included
1. Car Dataset Analysis
Description: This project analyzes a dataset of car specifications to uncover trends and insights.
Key Features:
Identified missing data and handled it effectively.
Conducted statistical analyses of vehicle attributes like weight, fuel efficiency (MPG), and horsepower.
Visualized relationships between MPG, weight, and engine displacement using scatter plots.
Created a pie chart to show the distribution of cars by origin.
Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy)
How to Run:
Load the car_info.csv dataset.
Run the script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
2. Monte Carlo Virus Spread Simulation
